    "\n",

    "        Animal.__init__(self, name, species=\"Dog\")\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        Animal.show_details(self)\n",
    "        print(f\"Breed: {self.breed}\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "class GoldenRetriever(Dog):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, color):\n",
    "        Dog.__init__(self, name, breed=\"Golden Retriever\")\n",

    "        Dog.show_details(self)\n",
    "        print(f\"Color: {self.color}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we have three classes: `Animal`, `Dog`, and `GoldenRetriever`. The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class, and the `GoldenRetriever` class inherits from the `Dog` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we create an object of the `GoldenRetriever` class, it has access to all the attributes and methods of the `Animal` class and the `Dog` class. We can also see that the `GoldenRetriever` class has its own attributes and methods that are specific to the class.\n",

    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name: Max\n",
    "Species: Dog\n",
    "Breed: Golden Retriever\n",
    "Color: Golden\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we can see from the output, the `GoldenRetriever` object has access to all the attributes and methods of the `Animal` and `Dog` classes, and, it has also added its own unique attributes and methods. This is a powerful feature of multilevel inheritance, as it allows you to create more complex and intricate classes by building upon existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of multilevel inheritance is that it allows you to reuse code and avoid repeating the same logic multiple times. This can lead to better maintainability and readability of your code, as you can abstract away complex logic into base classes and build upon them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, multilevel inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows you to create complex and intricate classes by building upon existing ones. It provides the benefits of code reuse, maintainability, and readability, while also requiring careful consideration to avoid potential problems.\n",

    "# Hybrid Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance in object-oriented programming. It is a type of inheritance in which multiple inheritance is used to inherit the properties of multiple base classes into a single derived class, and single inheritance is used to inherit the properties of the derived class into a sub-derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, hybrid inheritance can be implemented by creating a class hierarchy, in which a base class is inherited by multiple derived classes, and one of the derived classes is further inherited by a sub-derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "The syntax for implementing Hybrid Inheritance in Python is the same as for implementing Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, or Hierarchical Inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the syntax for defining a hybrid inheritance class hierarchy:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class BaseClass1:\n",
    "  # attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "class BaseClass2:\n",
    "  # attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):\n",
    "  # attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Consider the example of a `Student` class that inherits from the `Person` class, which in turn inherits from the `Human` class. The `Student` class also has a `Program` class that it is associated with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Human:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "    \n",
    "  def show_details(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Name:\", self.name)\n",
    "    print(\"Age:\", self.age)\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Person(Human):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age, address):\n",
    "    Human.__init__(self, name, age)\n",
    "    self.address = address\n",
    "    \n",
    "  def show_details(self):\n",
    "    Human.show_details(self)\n",
    "    print(\"Address:\", self.address)\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Program:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, program_name, duration):\n",
    "    self.program_name = program_name\n",
    "    self.duration = duration\n",
    "    \n",
    "  def show_details(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Program Name:\", self.program_name)\n",
    "    print(\"Duration:\", self.duration)\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age, address, program):\n",
    "    Person.__init__(self, name, age, address)\n",
    "    self.program = program\n",
    "    \n",
    "  def show_details(self):\n",
    "    Person.show_details(self)\n",
    "    self.program.show_details()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `Student` class inherits from the `Person` class, which in turn inherits from the `Human` class. The `Student` class also has an association with the `Program` class. This is an example of `Hybrid Inheritance` in action, as it uses both Single Inheritance and Association to achieve the desired inheritance structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `Student` object, we can do the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "program = Program(\"Computer Science\", 4)\n",
    "student = Student(\"John Doe\", 25, \"123 Main St.\", program)\n",
    "student.show_details()\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Name: John Doe\n",
    "Age: 25\n",
    "Address: 123 Main St.\n",
    "Program Name: Computer Science\n",
    "Duration: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we can see from the output, the `Student` object has access to all the attributes and methods of the `Person` and `Human` classes, as well as the `Program` class through association. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, hybrid inheritance allows for a flexible and powerful way to inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple classes in a hierarchy or chain."

    "# Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming where multiple subclasses inherit from a single base class. In other words, a single base class acts as a parent class for multiple subclasses. This is a way of establishing relationships between classes in a hierarchical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concept of hierarchical inheritance in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Name:\", self.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        Animal.__init__(self, name)\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        Animal.show_details(self)\n",
    "        print(\"Species: Dog\")\n",
    "        print(\"Breed:\", self.breed)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, color):\n",
    "        Animal.__init__(self, name)\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_details(self):\n",
    "        Animal.show_details(self)\n",
    "        print(\"Species: Cat\")\n",
    "        print(\"Color:\", self.color)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, the `Animal` class acts as the base class for two subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`. The `Dog` class and the `Cat` class inherit the attributes and methods of the `Animal` class. However, they can also add their own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating objects of the `Dog` and `Cat` classes and accessing their attributes and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Max\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "dog.show_details()\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Luna\", \"Black\")\n",
    "cat.show_details()\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name: Max\n",
    "Species: Dog\n",
    "Breed: Golden Retriever\n",
    "Name: Luna\n",
    "Species: Cat\n",
    "Color: Black\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we can see from the outputs, the `Dog` and `Cat` classes have inherited the attributes and methods of the `Animal` class, and have also added their own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, hierarchical inheritance is a way of establishing relationships between classes in a hierarchical manner. It allows multiple subclasses to inherit from a single base class, which helps in code reuse and organization of code in a more structured manner.\n",
